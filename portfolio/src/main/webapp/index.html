                        <p>Hello! I am a third-year computer science undergraduate from KNIT, Sultanpur. I have been a fan of Computer Science since my school days. 
                            Over the course of my engineering degree, I have tried my hands on various things like Android development, Computer architecture research, but most of my 
                            time has been spent in enjoying competitive programming. Other than coding, I love teaching and meeting new people.
                            I am also an advocate of increasing the participation of women in tech, and work as a volunteer with communities to support the cause.
                        </p>
